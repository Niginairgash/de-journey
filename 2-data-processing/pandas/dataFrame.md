# DataFrame: The Entire Library (A Table)

Think of a DataFrame as the entire library, which is made of multiple bookshelves.
* **It's Two-Dimensional:** It has rows and columns, like a spreadsheet or a SQL table.
* **It has Row Labels and Column Labels:** Each row has an index, and each column has a name.
* **Each column is a Series!** The "Fruits" column is one Series, the "Prices" column is another Series. A DataFrame is a collection of Series that share the same index.

  Example as a Pandas DataFrame:

      # Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
      data = {
          'Fruit': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'],
          'Price': [1.50, 0.80, 3.00],
          'Quantity': [10, 15, 5]
      }
      
      df = pd.DataFrame(data)
      print(df)

    You can think of it as:
    * The entire thing _df_ is a DataFrame.
    * The column _df['Fruit']_ is a Series.
    * The column _df['Price']_ is another Series.
